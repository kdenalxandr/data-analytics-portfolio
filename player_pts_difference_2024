-- By creating a temporary table, I was able to compare the top 10 players for the 2023-2024 Season points change.
With top_10_2024 AS (
  SELECT Player, PTS, Rk
  FROM `vernal-reality-440716-s9.nba_analysis.player_totals_24_clean`
  WHERE Rk <=10
)
SELECT a.Player,
a.PTS AS total_points_24,
b.PTS as total_points_23,
a.PTS - b.PTS as PTS_change
FROM top_10_2024 a
JOIN `vernal-reality-440716-s9.nba_analysis.player_totals_23_clean` b
ON a.Player = b.Player
ORDER BY PTS_change DESC;
